This project is about my master thesis：Learning based hybrid precoding in V2X .

_**Overview**_

- Trainv2_4inputs.py is about the design of the training process.

- loss.py contains the utility functions used in the whole project, such as the calculation for loss function, the conversion from output to precoding matrices and so on.

- network.py is the final network structure I‘ve used.

- config_parameter.py is about the setup for the parameter used in the whole project.

- The four files beginning with "evaluation" are the evaluation programs to evaluate and to compare the models under different parameter setup.

- dataset.npy is the dataset generated by Data_generation.py, which is then used for the model training.

_**usage instructions**_

First，train the model
- check in the bottom of config_parameter.py which goal you wanna train for, only communication. only crb or combined. Here I recommand you first train with the goal of only communication and then go further. It is worth noting that when you train for only crb, you need to modify the loss function in the train function in Trainv2_4inputs
